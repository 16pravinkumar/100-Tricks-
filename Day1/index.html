      /* filter: brightness(1.5);*/
      /*The CSS property `filter: brightness(1.5);` is used to adjust the brightness of an element on a webpage. In this case, the value `1.5` increases the brightness, making the element appear brighter than its original state. Adjusting the brightness can be a useful technique for visual effects or enhancing the visibility of elements on a webpage. */

      /* filter: contrast(6);  */
      /* The CSS property `filter: contrast(6);` is used to adjust the contrast of an element on a webpage. In this case, the value `6` significantly increases the contrast, making the dark parts  of the element darker and the light parts lighter. This can be employed for visual enhancements or to make elements stand out more distinctly on the webpage. Adjusting contrast is a common technique for fine-tuning the appearance of images or other graphical elements. */

      /* filter: blur(5px); */
      /* The CSS property `filter: blur(5px);` is used to apply a blur effect to an element on a webpage. In this instance, the value `5px` determines the extent of the blur, with a higher value resulting in a more pronounced blurring effect. This can be utilized for creating a sense of depth, emphasizing focus on certain elements, or for artistic and visual styling purposes on a webpage. */

      /* filter: drop-shadow(20px 20px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)); */
      /* The CSS property `filter: drop-shadow(2);` is used to apply a drop shadow effect to an element on a webpage. However, the value `2` seems incomplete and might cause unexpected results. Typically, the `drop-shadow` filter requires values for horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, and an optional color.
      filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
      This code creates a drop shadow with a horizontal offset of 2 pixels, a vertical offset of 2 pixels, a blur radius of 5 pixels, and a semi-transparent black color. Adjust the values as needed for your design. */

      /* filter: grayscale(10); */
      /* The CSS property `filter: grayscale(10);` is used to apply a grayscale effect to an element on a webpage. The value `10` in this case seems to be an incorrect usage. The `grayscale` filter accepts values between `0` and `1`, where `0` represents no grayscale effect (full color), and `1` represents complete grayscale (black and white).
      To apply a strong grayscale effect, you would use a value of `1`:
      filter: grayscale(1);
      If you want a partial grayscale effect, you can use a value between `0` and `1`, such as `0.5` for a moderate grayscale effect. Adjust the value according to the desired intensity of the grayscale effect. */

      /* filter: hue-rotate(90deg); */
      /* The CSS property `filter: hue-rotate(90deg);` is used to adjust the hue of an element on a webpage. In this case, the value `90deg` represents a 90-degree rotation of the color wheel. This can be used to shift the colors of the element, creating a visual effect where all colors are shifted by an angle of 90 degrees.
      For example, if the original color is red, applying `hue-rotate(90deg)` would shift it to green. This filter is often used for creative and artistic purposes to manipulate the color appearance of elements on a webpage. Adjust the degree value as needed for different color shifts. */

      /* filter: invert(0.5); */
      /* The CSS property `filter: invert(0.2);` is used to apply an invert effect to an element on a webpage. The value `0.2` represents the intensity of the invert effect, where `0` means no inversion (original colors) and `1` means complete inversion (negative of the colors).
      In this case, with a value of `0.2`, it applies a partial invert effect, resulting in a partially inverted color scheme. Adjust the value as needed to achieve the desired level of inversion for your design. */

      /* There are some more filter property that you can use based on your requiremnt  */
